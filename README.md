# My-Website

Contains the source code for my website: www.granttebeau.me. 

## Motivation

During my first semester of college, my roommate recommended that I create my own, personal website; he told me that not only would it look good for future employers, but it would also help me better understand basic computer science principles. Coming into college with only beginning experience in CS, I felt that this would really help; now, after awhile working on it on-and-off, it's finally up and running!

## Hosting

I got the domain name from [namecheap](namecheap.com), and I'm using Github Pages to host the website with this name.
